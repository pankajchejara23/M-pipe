# 16S Amplicon Sequence Reads
For this tutorial, we use 16S amplicon read sequences obtained from faecal sample from three patient groups:Healthy,Adenoma,CRC (Zackular et al., 2014). The authors investigated gut microbiome potential for predicting cases with colorectal cancer. They used 16S amplicon sequences for the analysis. You can read more about the study [here](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/7/11/1112/50234/The-Human-Gut-Microbiome-as-a-Screening-Tool-for).
