# Configuration file
All configuration information are stored in a seperate file `config.yaml`. This management of project-related data in a seperate file allows a greater reusability for the pipeline. 

The following table provides explanation for the configuration used in the pipeline.

| **Key**         | **Description** |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **scratch**       | Path to the working directory for the workflow. |
| **outputDIR**     | Directory where the Qiime2 output results are stored. The pipeline expects needed files in two subdirectories: `asv` and `tree`. This structure is generated by our upstream pipeline when processing raw sequence data. More details can be found [here](https://pankajchejara23.github.io/16S-workflow/). |
| **metadata**      | Path to the metadata file (TSV format) containing sample information. |
| **reportDIR**     | Directory where reports are generated and stored. |
| **target**        | The target attribute for grouping samples in analysis (e.g., disease status). |
| **target_groups** | List of groups present in the target attribute (e.g., normal, adenoma, carcinoma). |
| **colors**        | Colors corresponding to target groups for visualization purposes (green, blue, red). The number of entries must be the same as the number of entries in target_groups. |
| **alpha-measures**| Alpha diversity metrics to compute and plot. The pipeline supports the following measures: Shannon, Chao1, Simpson, InvSimpson, Fisher, ACE. Multiple values can be specified following `yaml` syntax. |
| **top-n**         | Number of top genera, families, or phyla to extract based on abundance. |


## Example config.yaml
The below is an example of `config.yaml`.
```{.yaml}
## Basic setup
project: trial
scratch: /Users/pankaj/Documents/Metrosert/16S-workflow
outputDIR: results
metadata: metadata.tsv
reportDIR: report

## Alpha diversity measures plotting
target: disease_stat
target_groups: # Groups in target attribute
  - normal
  - adenoma
  - carcinoma
colors:  # color for target groups
  - green
  - blue
  - red
alpha-measures: #Alpha measures to plot
  - Shannon
  - Chao1

top-n: 5 # Number of genus, family or phylum to extract based on their abundance
